# open-teddy
This repository implements a basic example of an AI buddy using Python and ChatGPT. It is based on my first iteration of the interactive teddy bear shown at my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@okunariumlabs9087). 

Currently, only the ChatGPT code is available. Additional code will be added to complete the implementation to coincide with the release of videos about the core components. 

An overview of the project is presented in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XS8u6wuXDQ&t=100s). 

## Dependencies

### Python 3.10
The example was tested using Python 3.10 on and the OpenAI package on Windows, Linux, and MacOS platforms. 

### OpenAI package
It is installed running 'pip3 install openai'. 

An OpenAI API key is required. It is obtained by creating an account with OpenAI. Add the key to the openai.key.  

## Executables

test_ai.py - This is a basic script for testing the ChatGPT functionality. It takes in input from the console and outputs ChatGPT's response. It benchmarks and displays the time it took to receive the response. The elapsed time is an important consideration for an engauging interactive experience.
